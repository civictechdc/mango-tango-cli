# Mango Tango CLI: Progress Manager Strategic Specification

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement

The current progress management system lacks consistent visibility during headless mode execution, particularly in n-gram analysis workflows. This creates a critical user experience gap that must be addressed while preparing for broader UI framework migration.

### Strategic Objectives

1. Resolve immediate progress display limitations
2. Create a simple, effective progress reporting architecture
3. Achieve full Textual framework integration
4. Provide clean, minimal progress tracking

### Scope and Constraints

- Immediate focus: N-gram analysis progress reporting
- Long-term goal: Full Textual UI framework migration
- Performance constraint: Minimal overhead in progress tracking
- Compatibility requirement: Support both CLI and potential web interfaces

## Architecture & APIs

### Current System Analysis

**Existing Components**:

- `ProgressManager`: Primary progress tracking mechanism
- `ProgressReporter`: Lightweight multiprocess-compatible progress tracking
- Key achievement: Simplified, Textual-native progress reporting

### Current Architectural Pattern

```python
class ProgressManager:
    def add_step(self, step_id: str, title: str, total: Optional[int] = None)
    def start_step(self, step_id: str)
    def update_step(self, step_id: str, progress: int)
    def complete_step(self, step_id: str)
    def fail_step(self, step_id: str, error_message: str)
```

### Integration Strategy

- Protocol-based design for backend interchangeability
- Context-aware backend selection
- Minimal configuration overhead
- Support for nested/hierarchical progress tracking

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Progress Reporting Simplification âœ…

- Implement streamlined ProgressManager
- Fully integrate with Textual framework
- Remove complex backend strategies
- Focus on clean, performant progress tracking

### Phase 2: UI Modernization ðŸ”„

## Decision Log

### Architectural Choices

1. **Textual-Native Design**
   - Rationale: Direct, performant progress tracking
   - Alternatives Considered:
     - Complex multi-backend approach (rejected)
     - Legacy Rich-based implementations

2. **Simplified Progress Management**
   - Key design principles:
     - Minimal configuration
     - Direct Textual integration
     - Clean, consistent user experience

3. **Performance Focus**
   - Goal: Lightweight, efficient tracking
   - Prioritize simplicity and minimal overhead

## Performance Considerations

- Overhead target: Near-zero performance impact
- Immediate initialization of progress tracking
- Fixed update frequency for consistency
- Minimal memory consumption

## Compatibility Matrix

âœ… Supported Modes:

- Interactive Terminal
- Headless/Background Execution
- Multiprocess Environments
- Web/Notebook Contexts

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Performance Degradation
  - Mitigation: Comprehensive benchmarking
- **Risk**: Backward Compatibility Breaking
  - Mitigation: Gradual, opt-in migration strategies
- **Risk**: Overly Complex Implementation
  - Mitigation: Strict architectural review, minimal abstractions

## Success Criteria

1. Clean, intuitive progress tracking
2. Zero performance overhead
3. Full Textual framework integration
4. Enhanced user experience in CLI

## Next Actions

- Complete Textual progress manager implementation
- Update existing test suite
- Document simplified tracking approach

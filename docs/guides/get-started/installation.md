# Setup

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

- **Python 3.12** - Required for all features to work correctly
- Node.JS (20.0.0 or above) - Required for the React dashboards
  to work correctly
- **Git** - For version control and contributing
- **Terminal/Command Line** - Application runs in terminal interface

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows (PowerShell), macOS, Linux
- **Memory**: 4GB+ RAM (for processing large datasets)
- **Storage**: 1GB+ free space (for project data and virtual environment)

### Resources

If you haven't installed git, node.js, and/or python yet refer to the
following links for instructions on downloading and installing said packages:

- [https://codefinity.com/blog/A-step-by-step-guide-to-Git-installation](https://codefinity.com/blog/A-step-by-step-guide-to-Git-installation)
- [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [https://realpython.com/installing-python/](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)

### Checking Dependencies

If you're not sure which packages you already have installed on your system, the
following commands can be used to figure what packages you already installed:

#### Linux & Mac OS

```bash
which <program_name_here (node|python|git)>
```

#### Windows

```PowerShell
where.exe <program_name_here (node|python|git)> 
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CIB-Mango-Tree/mango-tango-cli.git
cd mango-tango-cli
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

**Verify Python version**:

```bash
python --version  # Should show Python 3.12.x
```

### 3. Bootstrap Development Environment

**Mac OS/Linux (Bash)**:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**:

```powershell
./bootstrap.ps1
```

The bootstrap script will:

- Activate the virtual environment
- Install all dependencies from `requirements-dev.txt`
- Set up pre-commit hooks for code formatting

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
python -m mangotango --noop
```

Should output: "No-op flag detected. Exiting successfully."

## Activating Virtual Environment

After Completing the Installation the following commands can be used to activate
the virtual environment in order to work with the project.

**Mac OS/Linux (Bash)**:

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

**PowerShell (Windows)**:

```PowerShell
./env/bin/Activate.ps1
```

├── requirements*.txt       # Dependencies
└── mangotango.py          # Main entry point
```

## Database and Storage Setup

### Application Data Directory

The application automatically creates data directories:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/MangoTango/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Civic Tech DC/MangoTango/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/MangoTango/`

### Database Initialization

- **TinyDB**: Automatically initialized on first run
- **Project Files**: Created in user data directory
- **Parquet Files**: Used for all analysis data storage

No manual database setup required.

## Running the Application

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Start the application
python -m mangotango
```

### Development Mode

```bash
# Run with debugging/development flags
python -m mangotango --noop  # Test mode, exits immediately
```

### Development Mode for The React Dashboards

The following commands can be used to start the development vite server for the
react dashboards that are currently in development.

**npm**:

```bash
cd ./app/web_templates
npm run dev
```

**pnpm**:

```bash
cd ./app/web_templates
pnpm dev
```

## Testing Setup

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest analyzers/hashtags/test_hashtags_analyzer.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test function
pytest analyzers/hashtags/test_hashtags_analyzer.py::test_gini
```

### Test Data

- Test data is co-located with analyzers in `test_data/` directories
- Each analyzer should include its own test files
- Tests use sample data to verify functionality

## Build Setup (Optional)

### Executable Building

```bash
# Build standalone executable
pyinstaller pyinstaller.spec

# Output will be in dist/ directory
```

### Bundle Building for React Dashboard

**npm**:

```bash
npm run build
```

**pnpm**:

```bash
pnpm build
```

### Build Requirements

- Included in `requirements-dev.txt`
- Used primarily for release distribution
- Not required for development

## IDE Integration

### Recommended IDE Settings

- Python interpreter: `./venv/bin/python`
- Black formatter integration
- isort integration
- pytest test discovery

**PyCharm**:

- Interpreter: Project virtual environment
- Code style: Black
- Import optimizer: isort

### Git Configuration

**Pre-commit Hooks**:

```bash
# Hooks are set up automatically by bootstrap script
# Manual setup if needed:
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

**Git Flow**:

- Branch from `develop` (not `main`)
- Feature branches: `feature/name`
- Bug fixes: `bugfix/name`

## Version Management

If you already have Python and Node.JS installed but are on different versions
from the versions outlined in the [requirements](#prerequisites) above you can switch
to the correct versions for both languages for the project using version managers.
The version manager for python is [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).
Where the version manager that is recommended for Node is [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
Guides for installing both version managers are linked down below if you need
references to go off of.

- [https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/)
- [https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
- [https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win?tab=readme-ov-file#installation](https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)
  (If you're on windows and want to install pyenv)

Once you have both version managers installed the following commands can be used
to switch versions.

### pyenv

```shell
pyenv install 3.12
pyenv local 3.12
```

### nvm

```shell
nvm install v21.0.0
nvm use v21.0.0
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Dependency Issues

One common issue when installing the dependencies for python is the installation
failing due to compatibility issues with the python package `pyarrow`. The compatibility
issues are due to a version mismatch between pyarrow and python itself.
To resolve this issue,you **MUST** be on version **3.12** for python.
Refer to [commands above](#pyenv) to switch to the correct version.

Similarly, the installation for node dependencies has been known to fail for
some developers due to a version mismatch caused by the underlying dependencies
for the package `@glideapps/glide-data-grid`. However, getting around this issue
is more straightforward with node packages. Running the installation command for
node with the flag `--legacy-peer-deps` is enough for the installation to work
if you run into this issue. The commands needed to run the installation manually
from the project root are as such.

```bash
cd ./app/web_templates
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Other Common Issues

**Import Errors**:

```bash
# Ensure virtual environment is activated
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1     # Windows

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

**Formatting Errors in CI**:

```bash
# Run formatters locally before committing
isort .
black .
```

**Test Failures**:

```bash
# Ensure test data is present
ls analyzers/*/test_data/

# Check if specific analyzer tests pass
pytest analyzers/hashtags/ -v
```

### Environment Variables

**Optional Configuration**:

- `MANGOTANGO_DATA_DIR` - Override default data directory
- `MANGOTANGO_LOG_LEVEL` - Set logging verbosity
